# Welcome to my Humble Code Abode üôè

## About Me
I've been involved with technology and interactivity for most of my life and enjoy taking things apart to figure out how they work. I'm an excellent researcher and self-learner with a passion for knowledge and understanding. I'm currently participating in a 'batch' at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) to sharpen my coding skills and gain inspiration from a cohort of talented programmers. In my former life I was a Lighting and Sound Designer and Production Manager for Theatre, Opera, and Dance. I've also spent significant time teaching those subjects at the university level.
