# Welcome to my Humble Code Abode üôè

I'm currently a Production Manager, Lighting Designer, and Sound Designer for the entertainment industry where I've been for most of my adult life. I've had a long history with technology and interactivity. I've also spent a significant amount of time working in higher education. In my free time I'm working on my developmnet and engineering skills. I'd like to take on contract work where I'm able to around my current full time job and see where that leads. 

I enjoy geeking out about data visualization ,front end design/development, UX, back end architecture, project management and DevOps. 

I find great joy in taking things apart to figure out how they work, and the comprehension about systems and the people that interface with them that comes with that endeavor. 

I am proficient in HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS and know a little React/Redux, Python, Django, and C. I've also done some C++ and Max/MSP for funky interactive art pieces with Arduino. 

I'm currently learning more advanced Javascript skills, drilling fundamentals, and improving my overall front end webdev toolkit. 
I enjoy exploring project management methodologies and apply my experience and skills on professional projects to my own self development as well (so many trello boards...)

I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects with some entry level type needs and a community willing to exchange mentorship and knowledge for contribution. 

I'm particularly interested in environmental/ecological issues, civic/social justice issues, access to education and public resources, and government efficiency and transparency.

- zenlex (profile name) is a nickname that came from my time spent working for the Ohio Light Opera where my tall frame and shaved head led one of the veteran staffers to comment that I looked like Lex Luthor. I remarked that I was not an ambitious supervillain but rather a humble Zen Buddhist and thus the persona of Zen Lex was born. Theatre people are an interesting bunch.
